For one cup of "stallion", you'll need:
<ul>
    <li>A matchbox full of finely ground black tea.</li>
    <li>Two teaspoons of water-soluble coffee.</li>
    <li>A cup of piping hot water.</li>
    <li>Optionally, a squeeze of sweetened condensed milk.</li>
</ul>

First, you'll brew the black tea in a separate cup using half your water. Put in the whole matchbox. Ignore brewing
suggestions on the packaging; the water has to be 100Â°C sharp.

Once you've set your tea base to ripen, brew your coffee right in the drinking cup.

Wait for 5 or so minutes for the tea to release the flavor and a "stallion" dose of caffeine, and pour the whole cup
into the coffee.

Add sweetened condensed milk to the resulting tonic to make it slightly more drinkable. You're done (for)!
