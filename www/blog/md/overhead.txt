There is no such thing as overhead from calling native C functions: the loss in performance comes from the surrounding
interpreted environment.

Calling a C function by pointer, from the executor's standpoint, is just as quick as evaluating an expression in the
language in question; both actions are expressed in native code anyways.

But say, we'd like to draw an image pointwise by using a native <code>putPixel</code> procedure. The pure-native
implementation would take less than a millisecond to run on decent hardware. The interpreted implementation would
struggle for minutes before it outputs anything.

The amount of runtime the interpreter spends evaluating a nested loop and its scope boundaries, running garbage
collection, boxing/unboxing dynamic values and performing type safety checks on them is orders of magnitude larger than
how long the <code>putPixel</code> calls would take.

With that said, if you ever need to use a C library inside your JavaScript/Python project, <i>consider whether you need<!--
--> JavaScript/Python at all</i>.
