<h1>about me</h1>
<p>there is not much else to say what hadn't been said <a href="/">back home</a>.</p>
<p>here are my hardware specs btw:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Intel Core i9 10900KF on a $5 motherboard.</li>
    <li>used NVIDIA GTX560 from a scrapyard computer.</li>
    <li>single-channel 16GB RAM because the other slot is blocked by my CPU cooler.</li>
    <li>chinese 520GB SSD with 5 years warranty that broke down in less than a year of use prior. at least you get the 5 years warranty back on each replacement.</li>
</ul>
<p>rocking good ol' Windows 10 since the dawn of time. used to use Arch Linux on older hardware, but had to switch due to academic software (see below) not working properly (at all).</p>
<p><s>(2025-07-09: half the last paragraph is obsolete: back to Arch as of now)</s></p>
<p>(2025-08-12: relevant again because i'm back to Weendose...)</p>
<p>"academic software" includes: Microsoft Office, Weendose-only IDEs (Dev-C++...), misc. crapware from 2005 -- all required to pass mandatory subjects.</p>
<p>also, for whatever reason, the super-legacy proprietary NVIDIA drivers for Linux don't even support Vulkan as opposed to the Windows drivers. this means i can't run Wayland or play 90% of modern games despite having enough compute to run them on some decent graphics settings.</p>
<p>while you're still here, make sure to take a look at my dog:</p>
